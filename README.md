# Intro

A remote multi server automation tool (Capistrano/Fabric) in Clojure.


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/re-ops/re-mote.png)](https://travis-ci.org/re-ops/re-mote)

# Goals and motivation
 
 * A clear roles to host matching model which can be extended easily.
 
 * Can be used both as a library and as a standalone tool.

 * An easy to follow Clojure DSL. 

 * Functional interface.

 * Inspired by Capistrano but more flexible.

# Install 

```bash 
$ wget -qO - http://bit.ly/barbecue-ops  | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo add-apt-repository 'deb http://celestial-ops.com/barbecue quantal main'
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install supernal
```

Make sure to enable JCE:

```bash
# Download http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html
$ unzip UnlimitedJCEPolicyJDK7.zip
$ sudo cp UnlimitedJCEPolicy/* /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/lib/security/
```

# Usage

We will follow a basic code deployment scenario, note that supernal uses SSH under to hood and expects the running user ssh key to be autorized on the remote machine end (see ssh-copy-id and authorized file).

## Defining tasks

We define tasks using a Clojure DSL where each task is enclosed within a namespace:

```clojure
; baseline.clj

(ns- deploy 
  (task update-code
    (let [{:keys [src app-name run-id]} args]
      (debug "updating code on" remote) 
      (copy src (releases app-name run-id)))) 
 
  (task post-update
    (let [{:keys [src app-name run-id]} args file (last (split src #"/")) 
          basepath (releases app-name run-id)]
      (when-let [ext (archive? file)]
        (debug ext)
        (run ((archive-types (<< "~{basepath}~{file}") basepath) ext)))))

  (task start 
    (debug "starting service on" remote)) 
 
  (task symlink
    (let [{:keys [app-name run-id]} args]
      (run (<< "rm -f ~(current app-name)"))
      (run (<< "ln -s ~(releases app-name run-id) ~(current app-name)"))))

  (task stop
    (debug "stopping service on" remote))
     
  (task pre-update
    (let [{:keys [app-name run-id]} args release-id (date-fmt)]
      (swap! run-ids assoc run-id release-id)
      (run (<< "mkdir ~(releases app-name run-id) -p"))
      (run (<< "chown ~(remote :user) ~(releases app-name run-id)"))))) 
```

We define how the task relate to each other using a lifecycle definition (basicly a graph):

```clojure
(lifecycle base-deploy
  {deploy/update-code #{deploy/post-update deploy/symlink}
   deploy/stop #{deploy/update-code}
   deploy/pre-update #{deploy/update-code}
   deploy/symlink #{deploy/start} 
   deploy/post-update #{deploy/start}
   deploy/start #{}})
```

Lastly we define our running enviroment which includes the mapping from roles to specific hosts:

```clojure
(env 
  {:roles {
      :web #{{:host "foobar" :user "vagrant" :sudo true}}}
   })

```

By default your ~/.ssh/id_rsa key is used, in order to override:

```clojure
; setting custom ssh info
(supernal.core/ssh-config {:key "/home/foo/id_rsa" :user "bar"})
```


## Launch
We can either launch it using programatic api:

```clojure
(def artifact "git://github.com/narkisr/swag.git")

(execute base-deploy {:app-name "foo" :src artifact} :web)
```

Or using the sup binary:

```bash
$ sup run -s fixtures/deploy.clj base-deploy -r web
```

## Sup binary

The sup binary supports listing and running of single tasks/lifecycles:

```bash 
# using deploy.clj 
$ sup list 
Lifecycles:
  base-rollback - base deployment roleback
  base-deploy - base deployment scheme
  base-success - base deployment success
Tasks:
  deploy:
   stop - Stoping server foo
   pre-update - pre code update actions
   start - starts deployed service
   post-update - runs post code update actions
   symlink - links current version to current
   update-code - updates deployed code
```

sup will use deploy.clj by default we can specify a custom filename:

```bash
$ sup list -s foo.clj
```

Launching a complete lifecycle on a role:

```bash 
$ sup run deploy -r web 
```

We can also launch single tasks:

```bash
$ sup run deploy/stop -r web 
```

Passing args to task/lifecycle:

```bash
$ sup run {task/lifecycle} -r web  -a "src='foo',app-name='bla'"
```
