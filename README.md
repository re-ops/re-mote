# Intro

A live coding environment for remote operations.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/celestial-ops/supernal.png)](https://travis-ci.org/celestial-ops/supernal)

## Motivation

Most (if not all) configuration management tools currently are static in nature, you write you code deploy it and apply (rinse and repeat).

Still our live environments change rapidly and having this cycle in place really slows our reaction time down.

After working in Clojure for a long time iv found that the REPL is the most powerful environment to code in, there is no reason we cant use this enviroment to drive our operations faster!
